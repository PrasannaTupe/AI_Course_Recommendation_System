    "### What We Did:\n",
    "1. Data Loading & Preprocessing:\n",
    "- We started with a dataset containing course titles and summaries in a DataFrame (df).\n",
    "- We cleaned and transformed the text by extracting skills from the Title and Summary columns using spaCy to identify relevant entities.\n",
    "2. Unique Skills Set:\n",
    "- We created a set of unique skills from another DataFrame (df2) by extracting a specific column (ALL) that contained skill keywords.\n",
    "- We used ast.literal_eval() to handle list-like strings and cleaned the extracted skills by converting them to lowercase.\n",
    "3. Matching Skills with Titles & Summaries:\n",
    "- We combined both the Title and Summary columns of each course, converted all words to lowercase, and used spaCy to extract named entities.\n",
    "- We compared the extracted skills with the unique_skills_df2 set, keeping only the matching skills.\n",
    "- We handled cases where no skills were found and displayed 'No Skills Found' for those rows.\n",
    "4. Removing Irrelevant Words:\n",
    "- We removed common English words like \"course,\" \"learn,\" and other non-technical terms from the skills list using a predefined set of irrelevant words (e.g., articles, prepositions).\n",
    "5. Making Skills Unique:\n",
    "- Ensured that duplicate skills within a row were removed, ensuring each skill was unique.\n",
    "6. Appending Common Skills:\n",
    "- We added a set of common tech and business-related skills (e.g., \"java,\" \"html,\" \"excel\") to the existing skills set (unique_skills_df2), making sure only unique skills were added.\n",
    "7. Exporting Data:\n",
    "- Finally, we exported the modified df with the skills column to a CSV file and saved it to a specific folder on the local system using to_csv().\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "### Challenges Faced\n",
    "1. Skill Extraction Using spaCy:\n",
    "SpaCy’s NER (Named Entity Recognition) did not extract specific technical skills like programming languages or tools, as NER focuses on entities like organizations, locations, and products.\n",
    "2. Handling Mixed Data Formats:\n",
    "Some columns contained string representations of lists, and we had to safely convert them to actual Python lists using ast.literal_eval(), ensuring that malformed data was handled correctly.\n",
    "3. Case Sensitivity Issues:\n",
    "We needed to ensure all extracted skills were in lowercase to match with the skills set, which was also in lowercase. This required consistent handling of case normalization.\n",
    "Irrelevant Words:\n",
    "4. We had to identify and filter out non-skill-related words (e.g., common English words, course-related terms) to keep only technical or business skills in the final skills column.\n",
    "5. Handling Missing Skills:\n",
    "For some courses, there were no extracted skills, and we had to decide how to handle them (e.g., returning 'No Skills Found' for those courses).\n",
    "6. Updating the Skills Set:\n",
    "Ensuring that we correctly merged new skills (e.g., tech or business skills) into the existing unique_skills_df2 set without adding duplicates was tricky but was handled by using union() for set operations."

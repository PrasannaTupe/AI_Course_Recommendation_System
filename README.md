# AI Course Recommendation System

- This project is an AI-based Skill Gap and Course Recommendation System designed to help users align their skills with suitable job roles. 
- We first extract and normalize skills from online course datasets using NLP and a predefined skill dictionary. 
- Job roles and required skills are embedded into vector representations using sentence-transformer embeddings, and cosine similarity is used to identify the best-matching job role for a user’s skills. 
- The system then performs skill gap analysis to detect missing or weak skills. 
- Finally, it recommends the most relevant online courses from platforms like Coursera and Udemy to bridge those skill gaps.
